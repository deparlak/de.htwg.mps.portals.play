		<b>Rules</b><br/>
		After starting a game, you can add as many snakes as you like. Currently all snakes are striving for the one apple.<br/> 
		A snake is controlled via mouse. To change snake's direction, click on the cells just next to the snake's head cell.<br/>
		Example: to move a snake down when snake's head is on cell row 2 and column 4, click on row 3 and column 4.<br/>
		The game ends when a snake eats its tale or a snake goes outside the snakeyard.<br/>
